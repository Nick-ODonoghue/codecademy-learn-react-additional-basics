    <h2>React Styles</h2>

    <section>
      <h3>Inline Styles and Style Object Variables</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>React provides two main approaches for applying styles: inline styles and style object variables.</li>
        <img src="./assets/images/inlineStyles.jpg" alt="inline styles">
        <li>Inline styles are written as attributes and are enclosed in double curly braces:
          style={{ property: value }}.</li>
        <li>The outer curly braces indicate that the content should be treated as JavaScript.</li>
        <li>The inner curly braces create a JavaScript object literal to define the styles.</li>
        <li>Inline styles can become messy when applying multiple styles.</li>
        <li>An alternative approach is to store a style object in a variable.</li>
        <img src="./assets/images/styleObjectVariables.jpg" alt="style object variable">
        <li>To do this, initialize an object with style properties and values.</li>
        <li>The style object variable can then be injected using the style attribute: style={styleObject}.</li>
        <li>This allows for cleaner and more organized application of styles.</li>
        <li>The style object can contain multiple properties, such as color, background, font-size, etc., to define
          various aspects of the component's appearance.</li>
        <li>The values assigned to the properties can be strings, numbers, or other valid CSS values.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Style Syntax</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>When styling components with JSX in React, CSS property names are written using camelCase.</li>
        <img src="./assets/images/camelCaseStyleNaming.jpg" alt="camelCase style naming">
        <li>This is because hyphens are reserved operators in JavaScript, and using camelCase ensures consistency with
          the property names in the DOM style JavaScript object.</li>
        <li>Style values in JavaScript are usually specified as strings, even for numeric values, to allow for
          specifying units.</li>
        <li>If a style value is written as a number, the unit 'px' is assumed.</li>
        <li>For example, { fontSize: 30 } sets the font size to 30 pixels.</li>
        <li>To use units other than 'px', the value should be specified as a string, such as { fontSize: "2em" }.</li>
        <li>It's also valid to specify the 'px' unit in a string, although it's redundant.</li>
        <li>Styles can be defined in a style object variable using this syntax, where each property is written as
          propertyName: value.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Multiple Stylesheets</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>To make styles modular, organized, and reusable, it's recommended to create separate stylesheets for each
          component in React.</li>
        <img src="./assets/images/stylesheetImport.jpg" alt="stylesheet import">
        <li>Stylesheets can be imported using the import keyword, such as import './App.css'.</li>
        <li>However, when using multiple stylesheets with the same class names, there can be style conflicts.</li>
        <li>CSS modules can be used to prevent these conflicts and make styles scoped to specific components.</li>
        <img src="./assets/images/stylesheetModuleImport.jpg" alt="stylesheet module">
        <li>To use CSS modules, the stylesheet file should be named in the format fileName.module.css, where fileName is
          replaced with the component name.</li>
        <li>The CSS module file should be imported into the component file using import styles from
          './fileName.module.css'.</li>
        <li>The imported styles object will hold the class selectors defined in the CSS module.</li>
        <img src="./assets/images/classNameAttribute.jpg" alt="className attribute">
        <li>To apply styles from the CSS module, the className attribute should be used instead of class.</li>
        <li>React uses className to avoid conflicts with the reserved JavaScript keyword class.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h3>Review: React Styles</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>React components can be styled in a number of different ways: inline styling, object variable styling,
          stylesheets, and CSS modules. </li>
        <li>Inline styling can be used to apply styles to a single element. Inline styling can be done by giving the
          element an attribute named style whose value is an object literal surrounded in curly braces. </li>
        <li>
          An object variable can also be used to apply a style to a single element. The syntax is similar to inline
          styling, but rather than passing an object literal, the name of the variable is passed instead.
        </li>
        <li>Style names in React must be in camelCase. For example, background-color becomes backgroundColor.</li>
        <li>In React, a number style value is automatically interpreted with px.</li>
        <li>Styles can be separated and stored into CSS module files. The styles can be imported and used by applying
          className attributes to the relevant elements. </li>
      </ul>

    <h2>React Forms</h2>

    <section>
      <h3>Input onChange</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>In React, the state of a form can be managed by the component itself, unlike in regular HTML forms where the
          browser handles the form state.</li>
        <li>Updates to the form state in React are triggered by the onChange event.</li>
        <li>The onChange event fires when the user interacts with an input field, such as entering or deleting
          characters.</li>
        <li>When the onChange event is triggered, the component can update its state to immediately reflect the changes
          made by the user.</li>
        <li>By updating the component state, React can automatically update the view and provide a responsive user
          interface.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Write an Input Event Handler</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>An event handler function is used to handle user interactions with an 'input' element in React.</li>
        <li>The event handler function is called whenever a user enters or deletes any character inside the 'input'
          element.</li>
        <li>The event handler function listens for change events that occur in the 'input' element.</li>
        <img src="./assets/images/InputEventHandler.jpg" alt="input event handler example">
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Set the Input's Initial State</h3>
      <ul>
        <img src="./assets/images/inputsInitialState.jpg" alt="settings an inputs initial state">
        <li>The handleUserInput() function updates the userInput state with the text entered or deleted in the 'input'
          field.</li>
        <li>The state hook useState is used to manage the userInput state.</li>
        <li>The initial value of userInput should be set using the state hook's initial state value.</li>
        <li>In this case, the initial text in the 'input' should be an empty string to represent that no text has been
          entered yet.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Update an Inputs Value</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The value prop of an input element in React is used to control and sync the input's value with the
          component's state.</li>
        <img src="./assets/images/updateInputValue.jpg" alt="updating an inputs value">
        <li>Setting the value prop ensures that the input's value reflects the component's state, providing consistency
          and avoiding potential bugs.</li>
        <li>By using the onChange event, we can update the component's state with the new value entered in the input
          field.</li>
        <li>When the component's state is updated, the input's value prop is set to the new value, and the component
          re-renders.</li>
        <li>This approach makes the component's state the "source of truth" for the input's value, ensuring that form
          data remains consistent and can be easily managed and submitted.</li>
        <li>It is important to apply this pattern for inputs to keep them in sync with the component's state and provide
          a reliable and controlled user input experience.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Controlled versus Uncontrolled</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>An uncontrolled component in React maintains its own internal state.</li>
        <img src="./assets/images/uncontrolledComponent.jpg" alt="uncontrolled component">
        <li>An uncontrolled component, such as a regular 'input' element, keeps track of its own data (e.g., the text
          entered in an input field) internally.</li>
        <li>On the other hand, a controlled component in React does not maintain any internal state.</li>
        <li>Controlled components rely on external sources, usually through props, to control and access their data.
        </li>
        <li>By providing the value attribute to an 'input' element in React, it becomes controlled, meaning it no longer
          uses its internal storage to track its data.</li>
        <li>Instead, the value of the controlled component is controlled and accessed through props, usually managed by
          the component's state.</li>
        <li>Using controlled components is a common and recommended approach in React for managing form inputs and
          keeping the component's state as the "source of truth" for the input's value.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Review: React Forms</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The state of a React form is managed by the component, and updates are triggered by the onChange event.</li>
        <li>The onChange event uses an event handler to capture changes and determine what actions to take.</li>
        <li>A React form uses the State hook to store the value of the input field in the component’s state. The state
          can then be updated with the state setter. </li>
        <li>React components can be controlled or uncontrolled. Most React forms are controlled, as they control the
          input’s value with the state.</li>
      </ul>
